Allergen Detection System
#  Allergen Detection & Dietary Assistance System  

 ML-Based Food Safety & Calorie Management Solution  

 Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered food safety assistant** that helps users identify allergens in food, suggests safer alternatives, provides calorie insights, and recommends allergy specialists. The system is built using **Machine Learning (XGBoost, TF-IDF)** and an **interactive Gradio UI** for accessibility.  

## Features  
  Allergen Detection – Identifies if a dish contains a specific allergen.  
  Alternative Ingredients– Suggests safer substitutes for allergenic ingredients.  
  Safe Dish Recommendations – Provides a list of dishes without the selected allergen.  
  Calorie Management – Checks if a dish fits within a user’s calorie limit and suggests alternatives.  
  Allergy Specialists – Displays a list of expert doctors specializing in food allergies.  
  AI Model Integration– Uses **XGBoost & TF-IDF** for accurate allergen detection.  
  User-Friendly UI – Multi-page **Gradio** web app with dropdown selections.

##  Machine Learning Model  
1 Data Processing  
- TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction from text-based Ingredients.  
- Target variable: Allergen Presence (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  

2 Model Training  
- XGBoost Classifier trained with an 80-20 train-test split.  
- Evaluated using accuracy score.  
- Final Accuracy: `97%-98%` .
